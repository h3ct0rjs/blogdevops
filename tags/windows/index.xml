      <description>During a long time it&amp;rsquo;s been really dificult for me to work on Windows development enviroments, it was not a good sensation, but after giving a try during two months I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to work with, for my tremendous surprise there is a package manager out there, they&amp;rsquo;ve integrated a linux subsystem in the operative system and so many things more.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what key advantages you get when you use a package manager I will simple describe it as control, with a package manager you will have to install software and it will automatically download the appropriate package from its configured main software repository, install it, and set it up, all without you having to click through wizards or hunt down .</description>
