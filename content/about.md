Hello Everybody 😎,
My name is Hector Fabio Jimenez Saldarriaga, but you can call me H or Hector. I’m from the beautiful🌠country of Colombia 🌎. I’m Currently working as an Infra/SysOps Engineer at a local company, with some awesome technologies like AWS, and a few regional Datacenters. 
I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Systems Engineering, and also an Electrical Technology degree from Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira. I do really enjoy Computer Systems and everything related with electronics. In general, my main interests are Computer Security, Network Security, System Administration and DevOps; I usually use Unix, Gnu/Linux Enviroments (Currently trying to understand Windows Environments), and program in Python/Javascript languages.

I’m coorganizer of two local comunnities where I try to co-organize and collaborate in different kind of meetups/communities/cons here, in our beautiful city 😄. We want to build amazing products and use great latest technology by using the newest technology that is available for us. In Pereira we have PerTechTalks, which is a meetup community for anyone interested in multiple technologies, and Pereirajs, which is focused in JavaScript. Sometimes I assist attend to the Pypereira meetups, a Python based meetup, and there are others where I’m less active like JointDeveloper. 
We’ll keep the topics covered as broad as possible, making physical things, teaching to code, showing personal projects, and even having fun and being artistic with all kinds of technologies. We want to be open, inclusive, and to have the spirit of a community. Usually, if there is a meetup, I’ll be there. If you want to grab a couple of 🍻 or ☕, I will be happy 😄.

This site is personal, I talk about my opinion, not the one of my employees.
