      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since my personal computer was reinstalled I just remember that it was 3 years ago when I was having problems with my LUKS configuration, sadly I was unable to solved it so I just reinstall all my operative system entirely. Now recently I just finish a clean Debian install, I was refreshing my Gnu/Linux Laptop and all the tools. the thing here is that I was looking to have the same visual studio code settings in my new install.</description>
